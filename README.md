# PPT-Controller
PowerPoint Controller is an Android application that turns your smart phone into a remote for PowerPoint presentations. It comes with support for operating system Windows. It uses the Bluetooth or Wi-Fi capability of your smart phone for controlling presentations. PowerPoint Controller is an app that assists you in giving dynamic presentations by utilising hardware that you already have.


With this wireless software presentation device you can use your smart phone to switch between the slides of any PowerPoint presentation. It works with any Bluetooth enabled Windows computer. For instance, it is almost impossible to imagine watching TV or to use a DVD player without a remote control. While using a mouse or keyboard is easy enough, a remote control can help you avoid the distraction of navigating between slides and enable switching between them at the push of a button.

# Modules
   # a. Wi-Fi Connectivity Module:
      The Wi-Fi connectivity asks for the IP address of the system to be
      connected and verifies whether the IP address is valid or not. It will try to connect
      to the device whose IP address is given beforehand.

   # b. Bluetooth Connectivity Module:
      The Bluetooth connectivity lists all the available Bluetooth devices.
      Moreover, it shows the paired devices along with their MAC (Media Access
      Control) addresses.

   # c. Client Authentication Module:
      Client Authentication is the process by which users securely access a
      server or remote computer by exchanging a Digital ID. A Digital ID is an
      individual's identity (typically including the name, company name and location of
      the Digital ID owner) bound to a unique cryptographic credential.
   # d. Server Authentication Module:
      An authentication server provides a network service that applications use
      to authenticate the credentials, usually account names and passwords, of their
      users. When a client submits a valid set of credentials, it receives a cryptographic
      ticket that it can subsequently use to access various services.
   # e. Client-Server Communication Module:
      A computer network diagram of clients communicating with a server via a
      network. The client–server model of computing is a distributed application
      structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or
      service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients.
